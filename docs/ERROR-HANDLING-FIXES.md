# Error Handling Improvements

## Circuit Breaker Implementation

The circuit breaker pattern has been implemented to handle failures gracefully and prevent cascading failures. Key improvements include:

### Core Functionality
- Threshold set to 4 attempts before opening circuit
- 60 second cooling period for automatic reset
- Clear error messages indicating circuit breaker state

### Error Handling Flow
1. Message validation occurs first
2. Circuit breaker state is checked
3. Operation proceeds if circuit is closed
4. Failures increment counter and may trigger circuit opening
5. Circuit automatically resets after cooling period

### Key Components

```typescript
private readonly circuitBreaker = {
  failures: 0,
  lastFailure: 0,
  threshold: 4,  // Break circuit before 5th attempt
  timeWindow: 60000 // 1 minute cooling period
};
```

### State Management
- Tracks failure count and timestamps
- Resets state after cooling period
- Preserves state across operations
- Cleans up properly during context removal

### Error Types
- CIRCUIT_BREAKER: Indicates circuit is open
- RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED: Resource limits exceeded
- MESSAGE_PROCESSING_FAILED: General processing errors
- CLEANUP_FAILED: Resource cleanup issues

### Benefits
- Prevents cascading failures
- Allows system to recover automatically
- Provides clear error messages
- Maintains system stability

### Usage Example
```typescript
try {
  await contextManager.addMessage(modelId, message);
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof ResourceError && error.code === 'CIRCUIT_BREAKER') {
    // Circuit is open, wait for cooling period
    console.log('Circuit breaker is open, please wait and retry');
  }
}
```

## Testing
The implementation is verified through comprehensive tests that check:
- Failure counting and threshold behavior
- Cooling period reset functionality
- Error message clarity
- State preservation
- Cleanup processes
