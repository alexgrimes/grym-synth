# Health Monitor State Progression Fix

## Changes Overview
Fixed state transition validation in the Health Recovery Validator to properly handle state progression and metric thresholds.

### Key Components Modified
- `HealthRecoveryValidator`
  - State transition logic
  - Metric threshold validation
  - Historical data comparison
  - Logging enhancements

## Test Results
```
✓ should allow transition from healthy to degraded
✓ should prevent direct transition from healthy to unhealthy
✓ should allow transition from degraded to unhealthy
✓ should validate performance improvement
✓ should validate error rate stability
```

## Validation Steps
1. State Transitions
   - [ ] Verify healthy -> degraded works with warning thresholds
   - [ ] Confirm direct healthy -> unhealthy is blocked
   - [ ] Check degraded -> unhealthy with critical thresholds
   - [ ] Test recovery path through degraded state

2. Metric Validation
   - [ ] Verify performance threshold comparisons
   - [ ] Check error rate trend analysis
   - [ ] Validate historical metric comparisons

3. Logging 
   - [ ] Review state transition logs
   - [ ] Check metric validation output
   - [ ] Verify trend analysis logging

## Breaking Changes
None. Enhanced validation logic maintains backward compatibility.

## Performance Impact
No significant impact. Added checks use existing data structures.

## Documentation
- Updated HEALTH-MONITOR-STATE-PROGRESSION-FIX.md
- Added detailed logging for debugging
- Documented threshold configurations

## Testing Notes
Please verify:
- [ ] All state transitions follow valid paths
- [ ] Metric thresholds trigger appropriate state changes
- [ ] Historical data comparisons work correctly
- [ ] Logging provides clear diagnostic information
