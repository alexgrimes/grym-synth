# Resource Management Implementation Status

## Pool Manager Updates (February 2025)

### Core Improvements
1. Enhanced Health State Management
   - Implemented robust state transitions (healthy → warning → critical)
   - Added configurable thresholds (warning: 70%, critical: 90%)
   - Improved state change detection and event emission

2. Resource Tracking Enhancements
   - Added comprehensive stale resource detection
   - Implemented automatic cleanup of expired resources
   - Enhanced resource validation checks
   - Added safeguards against using stale resources

3. Performance Optimizations
   - Implemented LRU cache for frequent allocations
   - Added multi-tiered pool structure with priorities
   - Optimized cleanup cycles

### New Features
1. Circuit Breaker Integration
   - Added protection against resource exhaustion
   - Configurable failure thresholds
   - Automatic recovery mechanisms

2. Resource Metrics
   - Enhanced utilization tracking
   - Added detailed performance metrics
   - Improved monitoring capabilities

3. Dynamic Pool Sizing
   - Implemented automatic pool growth/shrinkage
   - Added tier-specific resource limits
   - Optimized resource distribution

### Testing Status
All tests passing for:
- Resource tracking and cleanup
- Health state transitions
- Resource allocation/deallocation
- Cache operations
- Error handling

### Integration Points
Successfully integrated with:
- Resource Detection System
- Health Monitoring
- Task Router

### Current Performance Metrics
Meeting all target metrics:
- Pool Allocation: <5ms
- Pool Release: <3ms
- Cache Hit Rate: >85%
- Memory Overhead: <50MB
- Cleanup Time: <100ms

### Next Steps
1. Monitor real-world performance metrics
2. Gather feedback on threshold configurations
3. Consider implementing adaptive thresholds based on usage patterns
4. Evaluate need for additional resource types
