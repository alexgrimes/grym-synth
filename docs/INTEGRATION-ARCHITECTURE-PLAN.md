# Integration Architecture Plan for grym-synth

## Overview
This document outlines the integration architecture for the grym-synth, a personal LLM orchestration hub for audio/music workflows. It integrates advanced resource management and innovative processing capabilities to support LLM orchestration, feature memory, and knowledge sharing.

## Integration Components

### LLM Orchestration
- Orchestrates multiple specialized models for tasks such as audio feature extraction, FFT processing, and LLM routing.
- Synthesizes outputs and intelligently routes queries to relevant modules.

### Feature Memory System
- Personal fine-tuning using audio/music contexts.
- Advanced pattern recognition, robust error handling, and scalable resource management.
- Provides context-aware resource tracking and state management.

### Knowledge Sharing
- URL-based knowledge aggregation.
- Collaborative distribution of resources.
- Seamless integration with knowledge bases and external data sources.

## Focused Integration Specifications

### 1. Health Monitoring Integration
- **Mapping Health States:** Map current system health states (healthy, warning, critical) to MCP-defined states.
- **Transition Rules:** Define precise transition rules and utilization conversion metrics.
- **Monitoring Data Propagation:** Ensure health monitoring data seamlessly propagates to single-purpose agents for informed decision making.

### 2. Resource Management Strategy
- **Supabase Integration:** Leverage Supabase connection pooling for robust infrastructure, including real-time updates and authentication.
- **Stale Resource Cleanup:** Implement timing and threshold triggers for cleaning up stale resources.
- **Interactions:** Outline interactions between resource tracking, Supabase pooling, and cleanup operations.
  
### 3. Test Coverage Requirements
- **Testing Matrix:** Establish test coverage for:
  - Resource cleanup operations.
  - Health state transitions.
  - Agent resource usage.
  - MCP state propagation.
- **Phased Testing Approach:** Separate tests for isolated components and integrated scenarios to ensure comprehensive evaluation.

### 4. Current Component Integration
- **Pool-Manager Integration:** Detail integration points in `pool-manager.ts` for both Supabase and MCP.
  - Resource tracking.
  - Health monitoring data propagation.
- **Agent Interaction:** Document how single-purpose UV agents consume and process resource and health monitoring data.

## Open Questions and Next Steps
- **Data Migration:** Evaluate strategies for migrating existing data to the new integration framework.
- **Monitoring Continuity:** Define methods to ensure continuous health monitoring during state transitions.
- **Agent Granularity:** Determine the optimal granularity for single-purpose agents based on processing needs.

## Conclusion
This integration architecture plan provides a blueprint for enhancing the grym-synth through modular design, precise resource management, robust health monitoring, and comprehensive testing. Each component works together to ensure a scalable and resilient system that meets the evolving needs of audio/music workflows.
