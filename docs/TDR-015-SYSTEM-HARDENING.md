# TDR-015: System Hardening Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The grym-synth requires robust error handling, performance monitoring, and resource management capabilities to ensure system stability and reliability. We need to implement comprehensive system hardening features that can handle service failures gracefully, monitor system health, and manage resources effectively.

## Decision
We have implemented a multi-layered system hardening architecture with the following core components:

1. Circuit Breaker Pattern
   - Prevent cascading failures
   - Automatic service isolation
   - Controlled recovery attempts

2. Service Recovery Manager
   - Centralized recovery orchestration
   - Configurable retry policies
   - Integration with circuit breakers

3. Health Monitoring
   - Real-time service status tracking
   - Memory usage monitoring
   - System-wide health metrics

4. Performance Monitoring
   - CPU and memory tracking
   - Event loop latency monitoring
   - Operation metrics collection

5. Resource Management
   - Priority-based allocation
   - Automatic resource cleanup
   - Resource usage tracking

6. Metrics Collection
   - Centralized metrics gathering
   - Configurable retention
   - Query capabilities

## Technical Details

### Component Integration
```typescript
interface SystemHardeningConfig {
  enableHealthMonitoring: boolean;
  enablePerformanceMonitoring: boolean;
  enableErrorRecovery: boolean;
  enableResourceManagement: boolean;
  healthCheckIntervalMs?: number;
  performanceCheckIntervalMs?: number;
  maxResourceMemory?: string;
  recoverableServices?: string[];
}
```

### Error Recovery Flow
1. Service failure detected
2. Circuit breaker triggers
3. Recovery manager notified
4. Recovery attempts executed
5. Service status monitored
6. Circuit breaker state updated

### Resource Management
1. Priority-based allocation
2. Resource health tracking
3. Automatic cleanup of stale resources
4. Memory usage monitoring
5. Resource pool management

### Monitoring Architecture
1. Health checks at configurable intervals
2. Performance metrics collection
3. Resource utilization tracking
4. Event-based status updates
5. Metric aggregation and retention

## Consequences

### Positive
1. Improved system stability through automatic error recovery
2. Better resource utilization through managed allocation
3. Comprehensive monitoring capabilities
4. Graceful degradation under failure
5. Centralized system health tracking

### Negative
1. Additional system overhead from monitoring
2. Complexity in configuration management
3. Memory overhead from metrics collection
4. Potential false positives in circuit breaker triggers

## Alternatives Considered

### Simple Retry Pattern
- Rejected due to lack of sophisticated failure handling
- No circuit breaker protection
- Limited monitoring capabilities

### Independent Monitoring Services
- Rejected due to coordination complexity
- Higher resource overhead
- More difficult to maintain consistency

### Manual Resource Management
- Rejected due to reliability concerns
- Higher risk of resource leaks
- No priority-based allocation

## Implementation Notes

### Critical Considerations
1. Configure appropriate timeouts and thresholds
2. Monitor memory usage patterns
3. Regular metric cleanup
4. Circuit breaker sensitivity tuning
5. Resource allocation priorities

### Integration Points
1. Service Registry integration
2. Memory Management integration
3. Metrics collection hooks
4. Health check endpoints
5. Resource allocation API

### Performance Impact
1. Minimal overhead from health checks
2. Configurable metric collection intervals
3. Memory-efficient metric storage
4. Optimized resource allocation
