# grym-synth: Model Orchestration Architecture

## Multi-Model Context Sharing Architecture

### Overview
The grym-synth project utilizes multiple specialized LLMs working together under the orchestration of a "boss" LLM (Deepseek R1 14b). This document outlines how these models share context while maintaining specialized processing capabilities.

### Core Architecture Components

#### 1. Central Context Repository
- **Purpose**: Serves as the single source of truth for project information
- **Implementation**: Structured database or in-memory storage system
- **Contents**:
  - Project metadata (goals, constraints, deadlines)
  - Shared assets (audio files, generated content)
  - Processing history (model interactions, decisions)
  - Contextual embeddings (vector representations of key concepts)

#### 2. Context Distillation Process
- **Managed by**: Deepseek R1 14b ("boss" LLM)
- **Function**: Processes raw outputs from specialized models
- **Methods**:
  - Extraction of essential information
  - Summarization at appropriate abstraction levels
  - Translation between domain-specific terminologies
  - Integration of insights into the shared context

#### 3. Targeted Context Transfer
- **Purpose**: Prevent context window overload in specialized models
- **Implementation**:
  - Task-specific context packages
  - Relevant metadata only
  - Hierarchical information structures
  - Compression of information when appropriate

### Model-Specific Context Handling

#### Deepseek R1 14b (Orchestration)
- **Context Access**: Complete
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Task delegation and prioritization
  - Context integration and management
  - Conflict resolution between model outputs
  - Overall project coherence

#### GAMA (Audio Processing)
- **Context Access**: Audio-focused with relevant project parameters
- **Input Context**:
  - Audio specifications and requirements
  - Stylistic guidelines
  - Previous audio processing history
- **Output Context**:
  - Processed audio analysis
  - Identified patterns and features
  - Recommendations for audio improvements

#### Qwen VL (Visual Processing)
- **Context Access**: Visual elements with audio relationships
- **Specialized Context**:
  - Visual representations of audio data
  - UI/UX designs for audio tools
  - Score notation and visualization

#### Coding LLMs
- **Context Access**: Technical requirements and implementations
- **Specialized Context**:
  - API specifications
  - Code architecture
  - Performance requirements

## Implementation Approach

### Hierarchical Context Structure

```
Project Context
├── Project Metadata
│   ├── Goals
│   ├── Style Guidelines
│   ├── Constraints
│   └── Timeline
├── Section Contexts
│   ├── Introduction
│   ├── Main Sections
│   └── Conclusion
└── Element Contexts
    ├── Instrument Tracks
    ├── Audio Samples
    ├── Effects Chains
    └── Technical Parameters
```

### Context Adapters

Each specialized model receives context through adapters that:
1. Filter irrelevant information
2. Format data appropriately for the model
3. Prioritize information based on the current task
4. Translate between domain-specific terminology

### Progressive Context Refinement

1. **Initial Context**: High-level project requirements shared by all models
2. **Specialized Processing**: Each model adds depth in its domain
3. **Context Integration**: Deepseek integrates specialized insights
4. **Context Evolution**: Shared context evolves as the project progresses

## Next Steps

Now that we've validated the loading and memory requirements of audio models like wav2vec2 (and eventually GAMA), here are the next implementation steps:

### 1. Service Layer Implementation
- Create persistent services for each specialized model
- Implement API endpoints for model interaction
- Set up resource management for efficient scaling

### 2. Context Management System
- Develop the central context repository structure
- Implement context adapters for each model type
- Create context distillation workflows

### 3. Orchestration Logic
- Implement task delegation logic in Deepseek
- Develop routing mechanisms for tasks and context
- Create feedback loops for iterative improvement

### 4. Integration Testing
- Test cross-model communication
- Validate context sharing efficiency
- Measure performance under various workloads

### 5. Specialized Workflows
- Implement music composition workflows
- Create audio processing pipelines
- Develop music software production toolchains

## Conclusion

The multi-model orchestration architecture enables specialized LLMs to collaborate effectively while maintaining processing efficiency. By intelligently managing context sharing, the system can leverage the strengths of each model while mitigating the limitations of context window sizes and processing capabilities.
