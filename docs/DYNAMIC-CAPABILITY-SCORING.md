# Dynamic Capability Scoring System

## Overview

The Dynamic Capability Scoring system provides runtime assessment and adaptive routing of model tasks based on historical performance metrics. This document details the implementation and key components of the system.

## Core Components

### 1. CapabilityScorer

```typescript
class CapabilityScorer {
  // Configurable scoring parameters
  decayFactor: number;      // Rate at which historical scores decay
  timeWindow: number;       // Time window for historical data (ms)
  minSamples: number;       // Minimum samples before scoring
  weightFactors: {
    successRate: number;    // Weight for success/failure ratio
    latency: number;       // Weight for response time
    resourceUsage: number; // Weight for resource utilization
  };
}
```

Key Features:
- Historical performance tracking
- Score decay over time
- Multi-metric scoring (success rate, latency, resource usage)
- Minimum sample thresholds for reliability

### 2. ModelOrchestrator Enhancements

```typescript
class ModelOrchestrator {
  async handleTask(task: Task): Promise<ModelResult>;
  async executeChain(chain: ModelChain, task: Task): Promise<ModelResult[]>;
  private executeWithRetries<T>(...): Promise<ModelResult>;
}
```

Key Changes:
- Phase-aware execution (planning, context, execution, review)
- Fallback model support with automatic failover
- Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Enhanced metrics aggregation

## Implementation Details

### 1. Capability Assessment

The system assesses model capabilities using:
- Success/failure history
- Response time metrics
- Resource utilization patterns

Performance targets:
- Assessment latency: <50ms
- Score calculation: <10ms
- Memory overhead: <20MB

### 2. Score Calculation

Scores are calculated using a weighted formula:
```typescript
score = (successRate * weightFactors.successRate) +
        (normalizedLatency * weightFactors.latency) +
        (normalizedResourceUsage * weightFactors.resourceUsage)
```

Penalties are applied for:
- High latency (>500ms): Steep penalty using pow(latency/500, 1.5)
- High resource usage: Quadratic penalty using pow(resourceUsage, 2)
- Severe performance issues: 50% reduction for latency >800ms or resourceUsage >0.8

### 3. Fallback Mechanism

The fallback system provides:
1. Automatic detection of model failures
2. Seamless transition to fallback models
3. Result aggregation with fallback tracking
4. Performance metric propagation

### 4. Historical Tracking

Time-based decay:
```typescript
decayedScore = score * pow(decayFactor, timeSinceLastUpdate / (24 * 60 * 60 * 1000))
```

Data management:
- Rolling window of performance records
- Automatic pruning of old data
- Configurable time window (default: 7 days)

## Integration Points

1. **ModelRegistry**
   - Model registration and discovery
   - Capability declaration
   - Chain configuration

2. **MetricsCollector**
   - Performance metric collection
   - Resource utilization tracking
   - Token usage monitoring

3. **HealthMonitor**
   - System status tracking
   - Performance anomaly detection
   - Recovery validation

## Usage

1. Configuration:
```typescript
const scorer = new CapabilityScorer({
  decayFactor: 0.95,
  timeWindow: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 7 days
  minSamples: 5,
  weightFactors: {
    successRate: 0.5,
    latency: 0.3,
    resourceUsage: 0.2
  }
});
```

2. Recording Performance:
```typescript
await scorer.recordSuccess(modelId, capability, {
  latency: 100,
  resourceUsage: 0.3
});

await scorer.recordFailure(modelId, capability, {
  latency: 500,
  resourceUsage: 0.8
});
```

3. Getting Scores:
```typescript
const score = await scorer.getCapabilityScore(modelId, capability);
const modelScores = await scorer.getModelScores(modelId);
```
