# TDR-008: ML Training Pipeline for Importance Scoring

## Status
Implemented

## Context
The importance scoring system needs to learn from user feedback and adapt over time. We need a robust ML training pipeline that can handle continuous learning, feature extraction, and model evaluation.

## Decision
Implement a machine learning training pipeline using TensorFlow.js with the following components:

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
   - Buffer training examples
   - Feature extraction and normalization
   - Dataset balancing

2. Model Architecture
   - Dense neural network with dropout layers
   - Input layer matching feature dimensions
   - Hidden layers (64, 32 units) with ReLU activation
   - Output layer with sigmoid activation for importance score

3. Training Process
   - Batch processing (32 examples per batch)
   - Early stopping to prevent overfitting
   - Validation split (20%) for model evaluation
   - Adaptive learning rate with Adam optimizer

4. Model Evaluation
   - Accuracy and loss metrics
   - Feature importance analysis
   - Confidence scoring
   - Performance monitoring

5. Visualization
   - Real-time training progress charts
   - Feature importance visualization
   - Model metrics display

## Implementation Details

### Training Pipeline
```typescript
const pipeline = new ImportanceTrainingPipeline(inputFeatureSize);

// Add training examples
await pipeline.addTrainingExample({
  messageId: 'msg1',
  features: [...], // Extracted features
  label: 0.8,      // Importance score
  metadata: {
    timestamp: new Date(),
    context: ['audio-processing'],
    userInteractions: [...]
  }
});

// Train model
const results = await pipeline.trainModel();
```

### Visualization
```typescript
<TrainingVisualization
  trainingMetrics={{
    epochs: [...],
    loss: [...],
    accuracy: [...],
    validationLoss: [...],
    validationAccuracy: [...]
  }}
  featureImportance={new Map([
    ['feature1', 0.8],
    ['feature2', 0.6]
  ])}
/>
```

## Dependencies
- @tensorflow/tfjs: ML model training
- chart.js: Training visualization
- react-chartjs-2: React components for charts

## Integration
The ML training pipeline integrates with the HybridImportanceScorer to provide:
- Adaptive weighting between rule-based and ML scores
- Confidence-based score adjustment
- Continuous learning from user feedback

## Testing
Tests are implemented in `test-training-pipeline.ts` covering:
- Training data preparation
- Model training process
- Model persistence
- Feature importance calculation

## Monitoring and Maintenance
- Monitor model performance metrics
- Track feature importance changes
- Regularly evaluate and update the model
- Save model checkpoints for rollback

## Consequences
### Positive
- Improved accuracy through continuous learning
- Adaptable to user preferences
- Transparent model decisions through visualization
- Robust evaluation metrics

### Negative
- Increased system complexity
- Additional computational overhead
- Requires sufficient training data
- Potential for overfitting with small datasets

## Future Considerations
- Implement more sophisticated feature extraction
- Add support for transfer learning
- Explore alternative model architectures
- Implement A/B testing framework
