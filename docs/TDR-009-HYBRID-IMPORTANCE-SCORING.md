# TDR-009: Hybrid Importance Scoring System

## Context

The current importance scoring system (TDR-008) provides a solid foundation with multiple scoring dimensions and weights. To improve its effectiveness, we want to combine user-defined weights with machine learning capabilities, creating a hybrid system that can adapt to usage patterns while maintaining user control.

## Decision

Implement a hybrid importance scoring system that:
1. Maintains existing scoring dimensions
2. Adds ML-based scoring
3. Uses adaptive weighting between user-defined and ML scores
4. Integrates with learning profiles
5. Provides visualization tools for insights

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **HybridImportanceScorer**
   - Extends ImportanceScorer
   - Manages both user-defined and ML-based scoring
   - Implements adaptive weighting
   - Integrates with learning profiles

2. **ML Model Integration**
   ```typescript
   interface LearningMetrics {
     userActions: {
       messageViews: number;    // View count
       timeSpent: number;       // Time viewing message
       references: number;      // Reference count
       reactions: number;       // User reactions
     };
     contextualMetrics: {
       followupRate: number;    // Rate of follow-up messages
       influenceScore: number;  // Impact on conversation
       themeAlignment: number;  // Theme consistency
     };
   }
   ```

3. **Adaptive Weighting System**
   - Balances user-defined and ML scores
   - Adjusts based on:
     * Model confidence
     * User engagement
     * Prediction accuracy
     * Learning progress

### Integration Points

1. **Learning Profiles System**
   - Tracks model performance
   - Stores user preferences
   - Manages learning history
   - Provides feedback mechanisms

2. **Visualization Components**
   - Weight configuration UI
   - ML insights panel
   - Confidence metrics
   - Performance analytics

### Data Flow

1. **Scoring Process**
   ```typescript
   async calculateImportance(message: Message, context: string[]): Promise<number> {
     // Get both scores
     const userScore = await getUserWeightedScore(message);
     const mlScore = await getMLScore(message);

     // Calculate adaptive weight
     const weight = await calculateAdaptiveWeight(message);

     // Combine scores
     return (userScore * (1 - weight)) + (mlScore * weight);
   }
   ```

2. **Feature Extraction**
   - User interaction patterns
   - Message characteristics
   - Contextual importance
   - Theme alignment

3. **Model Training**
   - Continuous learning from user feedback
   - Performance monitoring
   - Weight adjustment
   - Error correction

## Benefits

1. **Improved Accuracy**
   - Combines human expertise with ML insights
   - Adapts to usage patterns
   - Handles edge cases better

2. **User Control**
   - Maintains manual weight configuration
   - Provides transparency in scoring
   - Allows override of ML decisions

3. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Learns from user interactions
   - Refines scoring over time
   - Adapts to changing patterns

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Phase 1: Infrastructure**
   - Extend ImportanceScorer
   - Add ML model integration
   - Implement feature extraction
   - Set up data collection

2. **Phase 2: Learning System**
   - Implement model training
   - Add feedback collection
   - Create performance monitoring
   - Develop adaptive weighting

3. **Phase 3: UI/Visualization**
   - Add weight configuration UI
   - Create ML insights panel
   - Implement performance charts
   - Add user controls

## Risks and Mitigations

1. **Model Bias**
   - Risk: ML model developing unwanted biases
   - Mitigation: Regular bias testing
   - Solution: User override capabilities

2. **Performance Impact**
   - Risk: Additional computation overhead
   - Mitigation: Efficient feature extraction
   - Solution: Score caching

3. **User Trust**
   - Risk: Black box decision making
   - Mitigation: Transparent scoring
   - Solution: Clear visualization

## Future Considerations

1. **Advanced Features**
   - Multi-model ensemble learning
   - Context-specific scoring profiles
   - Cross-conversation importance

2. **Integration Opportunities**
   - Theme discovery system
   - Resource management
   - Knowledge graph

3. **Optimization Areas**
   - Feature selection refinement
   - Weight adaptation strategies
   - Caching mechanisms
