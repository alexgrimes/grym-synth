# Context Management System

## Overview

The Context Management System provides a sophisticated framework for maintaining and optimizing context across user sessions. It enables the system to remember user preferences, interaction history, and relevant patterns, ensuring a personalized and coherent experience.

## Key Components

### 1. Context Summarizer

The `ContextSummarizer` class is responsible for creating optimized context summaries for the LLM, ensuring the most relevant information is included within token limits.

```typescript
const summarizer = new ContextSummarizer();
const context = summarizer.summarizeForLLM(
  recentHistory,
  userProfile,
  relevantPatterns,
  systemState
);
```

#### Features:
- Token budget allocation based on priority weights
- Prioritization of recent and important interactions
- Efficient summarization of user preferences
- Pattern relevance inclusion
- System state summarization
- Fallback context generation for error cases

### 2. Preference Tracker

The `PreferenceTracker` class tracks and manages user preferences derived from both explicit statements and implicit behavior.

```typescript
const tracker = new PreferenceTracker();

// Track implicit preferences from interactions
tracker.trackInteraction(interaction, userProfile);

// Extract explicit preferences from messages
tracker.extractExplicitPreference("I prefer ambient sounds", userProfile);

// Get normalized preference vector for similarity calculations
const preferenceVector = tracker.getPreferenceVector(userProfile);
```

#### Features:
- Implicit preference extraction from interactions
- Explicit preference parsing from user statements
- Confidence scoring and decay over time
- Preference normalization for vector representation
- Contradiction handling between preferences

### 3. Relevance Scorer

The `RelevanceScorer` class scores patterns based on their relevance to the current context, helping prioritize which patterns should be included in the LLM context.

```typescript
const scorer = new RelevanceScorer();

// Score patterns by relevance to context
const scoredPatterns = scorer.scorePatternRelevance(
  patterns,
  context,
  10 // Optional limit to top 10 patterns
);
```

#### Features:
- Multi-factor relevance scoring (recency, frequency, similarity)
- Query term matching against pattern features
- Workflow relevance consideration
- Audio property similarity matching
- Active pattern prioritization

## Integration with Feature Memory

The Context Management System works closely with the Feature Memory System:

1. Relevant patterns from Feature Memory are scored and prioritized
2. User preferences influence pattern recognition and scoring
3. Interaction history informs pattern relevance

This creates a powerful workflow where:
1. Feature Memory serves as "long-term storage" for audio patterns
2. Context Management acts as "working memory" that determines what's relevant now
3. Together they ensure the LLM has the most useful context within token limits

## Data Structures

### User Profile

```typescript
interface UserProfile {
  id: string;
  preferences: Map<string, PreferenceData>;
  interactionHistory: string[]; // IDs of interactions
  favoritePatterns: string[];
  workflowHistory: string[];
}
```

### Interaction

```typescript
interface Interaction {
  id: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  type: 'user-input' | 'system-output' | 'audio-generation' | 'pattern-recognition';
  content: any;
  metadata: {
    importance: number;
    category: string;
    relatedPatterns?: string[];
    audioProperties?: {
      duration: number;
      sampleRate: number;
      channels: number;
    };
  };
}
```

### Interaction Context

```typescript
interface InteractionContext {
  query: string;
  currentWorkflow?: string;
  activePatterns: string[];
  audioProperties?: {
    duration: number;
    sampleRate: number;
    channels: number;
  };
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Context Optimization**
   - Prioritize recent and important interactions
   - Include only the most relevant patterns
   - Summarize preferences by confidence and frequency

2. **Preference Management**
   - Decay confidence over time for stale preferences
   - Prioritize explicit preferences over implicit ones
   - Track preference frequency to identify consistent patterns

3. **Pattern Relevance**
   - Score patterns using multiple factors
   - Limit context to the most relevant patterns
   - Consider both content similarity and usage patterns

4. **Error Handling**
   - Always provide fallback context when errors occur
   - Validate interaction data before processing
   - Handle contradictory preferences gracefully

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced NLP for Preference Extraction**
   - Implement more sophisticated natural language processing for extracting explicit preferences
   - Support complex preference statements and qualifiers

2. **Context Compression Techniques**
   - Implement semantic compression of context
   - Use embeddings to represent interactions more efficiently

3. **Adaptive Token Budgeting**
   - Dynamically adjust token budgets based on interaction patterns
   - Optimize for different LLM context window sizes

4. **Multi-modal Context**
   - Support audio and visual context elements
   - Integrate with multi-modal LLMs

5. **Relevance Scoring Improvements**
   - Implement machine learning-based relevance scoring
   - Incorporate user feedback on pattern relevance
   - Develop adaptive weighting based on usage patterns
