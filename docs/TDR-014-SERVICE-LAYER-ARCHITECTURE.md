# TDR-014: Service Layer Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The grym-synth requires a robust service layer to manage model lifecycles and a context management system for sharing information between models. This system needs to handle various AI models, maintain performance, and ensure reliable operations.

## Decision Drivers
1. Need for consistent model lifecycle management
2. Requirement for efficient context sharing between models
3. Performance requirements for real-time audio processing
4. Scalability concerns for multiple model types
5. Maintainability and testability requirements

## Considered Options

### 1. Singleton Services vs. Registry Pattern
- **Singleton Services**
  - Pros: Simple implementation, guaranteed single instance
  - Cons: Hard to test, tight coupling, difficult to manage dependencies
  
- **Registry Pattern** ✅
  - Pros: Flexible lifecycle management, easy testing, better dependency control
  - Cons: Slightly more complex implementation, needs careful synchronization

### 2. Context Storage Implementation
- **In-Memory Only**
  - Pros: Fast access, simple implementation
  - Cons: No persistence, memory limitations
  
- **Database Backed**
  - Pros: Persistent storage, larger capacity
  - Cons: Higher latency, more complex setup
  
- **Hybrid Approach with TTL** ✅
  - Pros: Balance of performance and reliability, automatic cleanup
  - Cons: More complex implementation, needs careful cache invalidation

### 3. Health Monitoring Strategy
- **Polling Based**
  - Pros: Simple implementation, predictable load
  - Cons: May miss short-lived issues, resource overhead
  
- **Event Driven** ✅
  - Pros: Real-time monitoring, efficient resource usage
  - Cons: More complex implementation, needs careful error handling

## Decision
We implemented a hybrid architecture with the following key components:

1. **Service Layer**
   - Registry pattern for service management
   - Factory pattern for service creation
   - Event-driven health monitoring
   - Typed interface contracts

2. **Context Management**
   - In-memory storage with TTL
   - Adapter pattern for model-specific transformations
   - Priority-based context handling
   - Async operations throughout

## Consequences

### Positive
1. Clean separation of concerns between services
2. Easy to test components in isolation
3. Flexible service lifecycle management
4. Efficient context sharing between models
5. Good performance characteristics

### Negative
1. More complex implementation than simpler approaches
2. Requires careful handling of async operations
3. Need for additional documentation
4. Learning curve for new developers

### Neutral
1. Requires consistent patterns across service implementations
2. Teams need to understand both service and context patterns

## Implementation Details

### Service Registry Pattern
```typescript
class ServiceRegistry {
  private services: Map<string, ModelService>;
  
  async getService(id: string): Promise<ModelService> {
    const service = this.services.get(id);
    if (!service) throw new ServiceNotFoundError(id);
    if (!service.isInitialized()) await service.initialize();
    return service;
  }
}
```

### Context Management
```typescript
class ContextManager {
  private repository: ContextRepository;
  private adapters: Map<string, ContextAdapter>;
  
  async getContextForModel(modelType: string, filter: ContextFilter): Promise<any> {
    const adapter = this.adapters.get(modelType);
    const items = await this.repository.query(filter);
    return adapter.adaptContext(items);
  }
}
```

## Performance Benchmarks

| Operation | Target | Achieved | Notes |
|-----------|---------|----------|-------|
| Service Init | <1s | ~800ms | Cold start |
| Context Fetch | <20ms | ~15ms | Cache hit |
| Task Route | <30ms | ~25ms | With context |
| End-to-End | <50ms | ~45ms | Full pipeline |

## Monitoring and Metrics

Key metrics tracked:
1. Service health status
2. Memory usage per service
3. Context retrieval times
4. Task processing times
5. Error rates

## Migration and Upgrade Path

For future upgrades:
1. Maintain interface compatibility
2. Support version transitions
3. Allow gradual service migration
4. Preserve context compatibility

2. Context Management System: `src/context/`
3. Integration Tests: `src/tests/integration/`
4. Performance Tests: `src/tests/performance/`

## Notes

- Regular performance monitoring is crucial
- Context cleanup should be scheduled regularly
- Service health checks should be configured appropriately
- Error handling patterns should be followed consistently

## Action Items

1. ✅ Implement service layer
2. ✅ Implement context management
3. ✅ Add health monitoring
4. ✅ Write documentation
5. ✅ Add comprehensive tests
