# GrymSynth Implementation Index

## Core Systems

### Health Monitoring
- **StateHistoryManager** (`src/lib/feature-memory/core/health/`)
  - Manages history of health states and transitions
  - Generic implementation for any timestamped entries
  - Type-safe health status tracking
  - Configurable history limits
  - Time-range based queries

- **ThresholdManager** (`src/lib/feature-memory/core/health/`)
  - Dynamic threshold adjustment based on system context and load
  - Historical trend analysis for threshold optimization
  - Context-specific threshold profiles
  - Learning from successful operations
  - Hysteresis to prevent threshold oscillation

### Audio Processing
- **HealthAwareAudioEngine** (`src/lib/audio/`)
  - Audio processing with health monitoring
  - WebAudio API integration
  - Performance tracking
  - Error handling with graceful degradation

## Feature Modules

### Memory Management
- **Memory Monitoring** (`src/lib/feature-memory/`)
