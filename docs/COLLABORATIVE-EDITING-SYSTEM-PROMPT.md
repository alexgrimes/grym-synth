# Collaborative Editing System Implementation Plan

## Overview

The Collaborative Editing System is a key component of grym-synth that enables multiple users to work together on audio projects in real-time. This system will allow users to share, combine, and manipulate audio patterns across different samples, fostering a collaborative creative environment.

## Objectives

1. Implement real-time collaboration for audio editing and pattern manipulation
2. Create a secure user authentication and session management system
3. Develop a permissions and roles framework for collaborative projects
4. Build a real-time notification and activity tracking system
5. Integrate with the Pattern Recognition System for shared pattern manipulation

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Real-Time Collaboration Engine

- [ ] Implement WebSocket-based communication for real-time updates
- [ ] Create a conflict resolution system for simultaneous edits
- [ ] Develop a state synchronization mechanism for consistent project state
- [ ] Implement operational transformation for audio pattern edits
- [ ] Create a session management system for tracking active collaborators

### 2. User Authentication and Project Sharing

- [ ] Implement secure user authentication with JWT
- [ ] Create user profiles with customizable settings
- [ ] Develop a project invitation system
- [ ] Implement public/private project visibility controls
- [ ] Create a user discovery feature for finding potential collaborators

### 3. Permissions and Roles Framework

- [ ] Implement role-based access control (owner, editor, viewer)
- [ ] Create granular permissions for different project elements
- [ ] Develop a permission request and approval workflow
- [ ] Implement audit logging for permission changes
- [ ] Create a UI for managing collaborator permissions

### 4. Real-Time Notifications and Activity Tracking

- [ ] Implement a notification system for collaboration events
- [ ] Create an activity feed showing recent project changes
- [ ] Develop presence indicators showing active collaborators
- [ ] Implement cursor/selection sharing for collaborative editing
- [ ] Create a chat system for real-time communication

### 5. Integration with Pattern Recognition System

- [ ] Enable shared access to detected patterns
- [ ] Implement collaborative pattern tagging and categorization
- [ ] Create a pattern sharing mechanism between projects
- [ ] Develop a pattern version history system
- [ ] Implement pattern attribution to track creator information

## Technical Specifications

### Collaboration Protocol

- **Transport**: WebSockets with fallback to long polling
- **Message Format**: JSON with operation type, payload, and metadata
- **State Synchronization**: Vector clock-based with conflict resolution
- **Latency Handling**: Optimistic updates with rollback capability
- **Offline Support**: Local changes queue with sync on reconnection

### Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control with fine-grained permissions
- **Data Protection**: End-to-end encryption for sensitive project data
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of real-time communication channels
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of all collaborative actions

### User Interface Requirements

- Collaborative workspace with real-time updates
- Visual indicators for collaborator presence and actions
- Permission management interface
- Activity feed and notification center
- Chat and communication tools

## Integration with Touch Gesture Support

The Collaborative Editing System will build upon the previously implemented Touch Gesture Support to provide an intuitive and responsive interface for collaborative interactions:

- Use multi-touch gestures for collaborative pattern manipulation
- Implement touch-based permission controls
- Create touch-friendly collaboration indicators
- Develop gesture-based communication shortcuts
- Ensure responsive design for collaboration on mobile devices

## Next Steps

After implementing the Collaborative Editing System, the next phase will be the Advanced Audio Processing System, which will provide sophisticated tools for transforming and enhancing audio patterns identified by the Pattern Recognition System and shared through the Collaborative Editing System.
