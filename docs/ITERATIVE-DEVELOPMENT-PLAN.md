## Prioritized Next Steps

Based on current progress, these are the recommended immediate next steps:

1. **Testing and Optimization (Iteration 1)**
   - Focus on verifying AudioLDM in your environment
   - Establish baseline performance metrics
   - Document memory usage patterns

2. **Integration with Orchestration Layer (Iteration 1)**
   - Implement basic task routing for analysis and generation
   - Test service handoffs
   - Set up priority handling

3. **User Experience Layer (Iteration 1)**
   - Create minimal demonstration interface
   - Enable basic audio generation testing
   - Implement essential controls

This prioritization allows you to:
- Quickly validate your implementation
- Connect it to your existing systems
- Create a way to demonstrate its capabilities

Each iteration provides a solid foundation for further development while maintaining flexibility to adjust based on findings and feedback.

## Development Philosophy

- Each iteration should produce working, testable results
- Iterations can be reprioritized based on emerging needs
- Focus on incremental improvements over big-bang releases
- Maintain balance between new features and system stability
- Regular testing and documentation updates throughout

## Measuring Success

Each iteration should be evaluated against:
1. Functionality: Does it work as intended?
2. Performance: Does it meet performance targets?
3. Stability: Is it reliable and robust?
4. Usability: Is it easy to use and understand?
5. Integration: Does it work well with other components?

## Adaptation Strategy

This plan is designed to be flexible and can be adjusted based on:
- User feedback and requirements
- Technical discoveries during implementation
- Resource availability and constraints
- Integration opportunities with new technologies
