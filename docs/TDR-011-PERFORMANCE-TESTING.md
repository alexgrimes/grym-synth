# TDR-011: Performance Testing Infrastructure

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The grym-synth needs a robust performance testing infrastructure to ensure reliable operation of its LLM integration. This includes measuring memory usage, response times, and model interaction efficiency.

## Decision
We will implement a modular performance testing infrastructure with the following key components:

1. Test Runner
2. Performance Suite
3. Metrics Collector
4. Test Plan Manager
5. Results Reporter

### Architecture Overview

    A[Test Runner] --> B[Performance Suite]
    B --> C[Metrics Collector]
    B --> D[Test Plan]
    C --> E[Memory Profiler]
    C --> F[Context Monitor]
    C --> G[Model Metrics]
    H[Results Reporter] --> I[JSON Output]
    H[Results Reporter] --> J[MD Report]
```

### Key Components

#### Test Runner
- Orchestrates test execution
- Manages test lifecycle
- Handles resource cleanup
- Implements CLI interface
- Coordinates output generation

#### Performance Suite
- Implements test scenarios
- Manages test state
- Coordinates metrics collection
- Handles phase transitions
- Provides test isolation

#### Metrics Collector
- Collects performance metrics
- Implements sampling strategies
- Manages metric persistence
- Provides real-time monitoring
- Handles metric aggregation

#### Test Plan Manager
- Defines test phases
- Specifies success criteria
- Manages test configuration
- Handles phase transitions
- Validates results

### Success Criteria

#### Baseline Performance
- Memory usage < 14GB
- Response time < 1s
- Context preservation > 95%

#### Cross-Model Performance
- Switch time < 2s
- Context accuracy > 90%
- Memory growth < 100MB

#### System Stability
- Concurrent requests: 10
- System stability > 99%
- Error rate < 1%

## Consequences

### Positive
1. Standardized performance measurement
2. Early detection of performance regressions
3. Automated test execution
4. Comprehensive metrics collection
5. Clear success criteria
