# Resource Management Architecture Decisions

## Core Architecture Decisions

### 1. Dynamic Resource Management
**Decision**: Implement fully dynamic resource management instead of static allocation.

**Rationale**:
- Local machine capabilities vary
- LLM model requirements are dynamic
- Pattern storage needs fluctuate
- System needs to adapt to load

**Impact**:
- More complex implementation
- Better resource utilization
- Improved adaptability
- Enhanced performance

### 2. Tiered Resource Pools
**Decision**: Use multi-tiered resource pools with different priorities.

**Rationale**:
- Different resource types have different priorities
- Some operations need guaranteed resources
- Enables better resource utilization
- Supports graceful degradation

**Impact**:
- More sophisticated allocation logic
- Better resource isolation
- Improved reliability
- Clearer resource prioritization

### 3. Integrated Monitoring
**Decision**: Deeply integrate with existing health monitoring system.

**Rationale**:
- Already have robust monitoring infrastructure
- Need real-time resource metrics
- Want to leverage existing alerts
- Monitoring is critical for resource management

**Impact**:
- Faster implementation
- More reliable monitoring
- Better system integration
- Reduced code duplication

### 4. Proactive Resource Reclamation
**Decision**: Implement proactive resource reclamation instead of reactive.

**Rationale**:
- Pattern storage growth needs management
- Multiple LLMs require careful resource handling
- Context preservation is important
- Want to prevent resource exhaustion

**Impact**:
- More predictable performance
- Better resource availability
- Reduced emergency situations
- Improved stability

## Implementation Decisions

### 1. Resource Detection
**Decision**: Implement continuous resource detection.

**Rationale**:
- System resources change during operation
- Need accurate resource availability
- Want to detect trends
- Support dynamic scaling

**Implementation**:
```typescript
interface ResourceMonitor {
  continuousDetection: boolean;
  updateInterval: number;
  thresholds: ResourceThresholds;
  onUpdate(metrics: ResourceMetrics): void;
}
```

### 2. Pool Management
**Decision**: Use priority-based pool management.

**Rationale**:
- Different resources have different priorities
- Need guaranteed resources for critical operations
- Want to support resource borrowing
- Enable efficient resource sharing

**Implementation**:
```typescript
interface ResourcePool {
  priority: PoolPriority;
  guaranteed: ResourceLimits;
  borrowable: boolean;
  onDepletion: DepletionStrategy;
}
```

### 3. Memory Management
**Decision**: Implement smart memory management with LRU and priority.

**Rationale**:
- Memory is a critical resource
- Different data has different importance
- Need efficient cleanup
- Want to preserve important contexts

**Implementation**:
```typescript
interface MemoryManager {
  strategy: 'lru' | 'priority' | 'hybrid';
  preserveRules: PreservationPolicy;
  cleanupTriggers: CleanupConditions;
}
```

### 4. CPU Management
**Decision**: Use adaptive CPU management.

**Rationale**:
- CPU needs vary by operation
- Want to maintain responsiveness
- Need to handle spikes
- Support background operations

**Implementation**:
```typescript
interface CpuManager {
  scheduling: 'adaptive' | 'fixed';
  priorityLevels: number;
  backgroundTasks: boolean;
}
```

## Integration Decisions

### 1. Health Monitor Integration
**Decision**: Deep integration with health monitoring.

**Rationale**:
- Already have robust health monitoring
- Need real-time health data
- Want unified alerting
- Support proactive management

**Integration Points**:
```typescript
interface HealthIntegration {
  metrics: string[];
  alerts: AlertConfig[];
  thresholds: ThresholdConfig;
}
```

### 2. Task Router Integration
**Decision**: Tight coupling with task router.

**Rationale**:
- Resource availability affects routing
- Need coordinated decisions
- Want efficient resource use
- Support load balancing

**Integration Points**:
```typescript
interface RouterIntegration {
  resourceChecks: CheckConfig[];
  routingPriorities: PriorityMap;
  loadBalancing: BalanceStrategy;
}
```
