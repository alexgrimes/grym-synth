# Technical Decision Record: Context Management System

## Status
Accepted and Implemented

## Context
The application needs to integrate both Ollama and LM Studio platforms while efficiently managing context across different models with varying context window sizes (DeepSeek: 8192 tokens, Qwen: 1M tokens).

## Decision
Implement a multi-tiered context management system with:
1. Category-based storage
2. Relevance scoring
3. Sliding context windows
4. Long-term archival storage
5. IndexedDB-based persistence
6. ContextManager class for automatic summarization and token management

### ContextManager Implementation
- **Purpose**: Handle conversation context with automatic summarization and token-aware management
- **Key Features**:
  - Automatic summarization of older messages
  - Token-aware conversation history management
  - Configurable context window sizes
  - Real-time context updates
  - Integration with Ollama for summarization
- **Benefits**:
  - Efficient memory usage
  - Preservation of important context
  - Optimal model performance
  - Seamless integration with existing storage system

## Rationale

### 1. Category-Based Storage
- **Why**: Domain-specific organization improves retrieval relevance
- **Benefits**:
  - Efficient context retrieval
  - Better semantic organization
  - Reduced context pollution
- **Tradeoffs**:
  - Additional complexity in categorization
  - Overhead in category management

### 2. Dual Model Integration
- **Why**: Different models have complementary strengths
- **Benefits**:
  - Leverage Qwen's large context for broad understanding
  - Use DeepSeek for focused responses
  - Fallback capability
- **Implementation**:
  - Model-specific context tracking
  - Automatic context updates during conversations
  - Seamless model switching with context preservation
- **Tradeoffs**:
  - Increased system complexity
  - Higher resource usage
  - Need for context synchronization

### 3. Storage Strategy
- **Why**: Need efficient storage and retrieval across different timescales
- **Benefits**:
  - Fast access to recent context
  - Efficient long-term storage
  - Automatic archiving
- **Implementation**:
  - IndexedDB for persistent storage
  - Conversation and message stores
  - Model context tracking
  - Real-time updates
- **Tradeoffs**:
  - Storage overhead
  - Complexity in managing multiple storage tiers

### 4. Context Window Management
- **Why**: Optimize use of limited context windows
- **Benefits**:
  - Maximum relevance in limited space
  - Dynamic adjustment to query needs
  - Efficient token usage
- **Implementation**:
  - Automatic context updates
  - Message history tracking
  - Model-specific context windows
  - ContextManager for token-aware management
- **Tradeoffs**:
  - Computational overhead for relevance scoring
  - Potential loss of context in compression

## Implementation Considerations

### 1. Storage Tiers
- Active Memory (RAM)
  - Recent conversations
  - High-priority context
- IndexedDB
  - Conversation storage
  - Message history
  - Model contexts
  - Category indices
  - Embeddings storage

### 2. ContextManager Configuration
- Token limits per model
- Summarization thresholds
- Context window sizes
- Summary quality settings
- Error handling policies

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- Caching strategy
  - LRU cache for frequent contexts
  - Preload category metadata
- Batch processing
  - Bulk embeddings generation
  - Periodic archival operations
- Lazy loading
  - Defer loading of archived content
  - Progressive category loading
- IndexedDB optimizations
  - Proper indexing
  - Transaction batching
  - Efficient queries

### 4. Error Handling
- Graceful degradation
  - Fallback to simpler context if complex fails
  - Automatic retry with backoff
- Data integrity
  - Versioning for context updates
  - Periodic validation
- Storage resilience
  - Transaction rollbacks
  - Error recovery
  - Data consistency checks

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Single Model Approach
- **Why Rejected**: Would lose benefits of complementary model capabilities
- **Tradeoffs**:
  - Simpler implementation
  - Less robust
  - Limited context capabilities

### 2. Flat Storage Structure
- **Why Rejected**: Less efficient for domain-specific retrieval
- **Tradeoffs**:
  - Simpler implementation
  - Poorer context relevance
  - Higher search overhead

### 3. Pure In-Memory Storage
- **Why Rejected**: Not scalable for long-term storage
- **Tradeoffs**:
  - Faster access
  - Limited by RAM
  - No persistence

## Consequences

### Positive
- Efficient context management
- Better response relevance
- Scalable storage solution
- Robust error handling
- Persistent conversation history
- Model-specific context tracking
- Automatic summarization
- Token-aware management

### Negative
- Increased system complexity
- Higher resource requirements
- More complex testing requirements
- Need for careful monitoring
- Browser storage limitations

### Neutral
- Need for ongoing optimization
- Regular performance review
- Periodic storage cleanup
- Browser compatibility considerations
