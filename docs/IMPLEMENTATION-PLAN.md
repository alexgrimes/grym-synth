## Conclusion

This hybrid implementation plan allows us to:
1. Deliver an MVP system quickly (by Month 4)
2. Maintain clarity on the full vision
3. Avoid over-engineering early versions
4. Create a clear path from MVP to complete system

By maintaining both the MVP track and the vision track in parallel, we ensure that our immediate implementation decisions are compatible with our long-term architectural goals while still prioritizing early delivery of user value.
