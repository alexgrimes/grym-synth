# MIDI Generation System Implementation Prompt

## Task Description

Implement the MIDI Generation System for grym-synth as outlined in the implementation plan (docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN-2025-Q2.md). This should include:

1. Creating algorithms for converting audio patterns to MIDI data
2. Implementing MIDI editing and manipulation capabilities
3. Developing MIDI export and integration with external tools
4. Adding real-time MIDI performance features
5. Integrating with the Pattern Recognition System

## Technical Requirements

1. **Audio-to-MIDI Conversion**
   - Implement pitch detection algorithms for monophonic audio
   - Develop polyphonic transcription for complex audio
   - Create rhythm extraction for accurate timing information
   - Implement velocity detection for dynamic expression
   - Add controller data extraction for expressive parameters

2. **MIDI Editing Interface**
   - Create a piano roll editor for note visualization and editing
   - Implement multi-track MIDI editing capabilities
   - Add quantization and timing correction tools
   - Develop chord and scale recognition and suggestion features
   - Implement MIDI pattern libraries and templates

3. **MIDI Export and Integration**
   - Support standard MIDI file export (.mid)
   - Implement real-time MIDI output to external devices
   - Add DAW integration via virtual MIDI ports
   - Create MIDI routing capabilities for complex setups
   - Support MIDI clock sync for tempo-based applications

4. **Real-time Performance Features**
   - Implement live MIDI generation from audio input
   - Add performance controls for real-time parameter adjustment
   - Create MIDI arpeggiation and pattern generation tools
   - Develop MIDI effect processors (humanization, randomization)
   - Implement performance recording and playback

5. **Integration with Pattern Recognition**
   - Connect pattern detection results to MIDI generation
   - Create pattern-to-MIDI transformation presets
   - Implement bidirectional editing between pattern and MIDI views
   - Add intelligent MIDI generation based on recognized patterns
   - Develop pattern variation through MIDI manipulation

## Implementation Approach

1. **Component Structure**
   - Create an AudioToMidiConverter service for transcription
   - Implement MidiEditor components for visualization and editing
   - Develop MidiExporter services for file and device output
   - Add MidiPerformer components for real-time features
   - Create a PatternToMidiMapper for integration with pattern recognition

2. **Technical Considerations**
   - Use Web MIDI API for device communication
   - Implement Web Workers for computationally intensive transcription
   - Use Canvas or WebGL for high-performance MIDI visualization
   - Leverage DSP algorithms for accurate pitch and rhythm detection
   - Implement efficient MIDI data structures for real-time manipulation

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Create a test suite with reference audio and expected MIDI output
   - Implement unit tests for individual transcription algorithms
   - Develop integration tests for the complete MIDI system
   - Add performance benchmarks for real-time MIDI generation
   - Test MIDI output with various external devices and software

## Success Criteria

1. The system can accurately convert audio patterns to MIDI data
2. Users can edit and manipulate MIDI data through an intuitive interface
3. MIDI export and integration with external tools works seamlessly
4. Real-time MIDI performance features are responsive and expressive
5. The integration with the Pattern Recognition System enhances workflow
6. The MIDI generation capabilities enable new creative possibilities

## Next Steps

After completing the MIDI Generation System implementation, the next step will be to implement the Collaborative Editing System, which will enable multiple users to work together on audio projects in real-time, sharing and manipulating patterns and MIDI data collaboratively.

## Continuation Pattern

After completing and testing this implementation, please create a new prompt for the next step in the implementation plan (Collaborative Editing System), and include instructions to continue this pattern of creating new task prompts until the core vision is fully implemented.
