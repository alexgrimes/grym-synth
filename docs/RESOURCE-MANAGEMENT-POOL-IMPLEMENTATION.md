# Resource Management Phase 2: Pool Management Implementation

Implement the pool management system for the resource management framework. This phase builds on the completed resource detection system from Phase 1 to provide efficient resource allocation and management.

## Context

Phase 1 Implementation (Completed):
- Resource detection system (memory, CPU, disk)
- Health monitoring and alerts
- Performance metrics collection
- All tests passing with performance targets met

Location: src/lib/model-orchestration/resource-management/

## Core Requirements

### Pool Manager Implementation
```typescript
interface ResourcePool {
  allocate(request: ResourceRequest): Promise<Resource>;
  release(resource: Resource): Promise<void>;
  optimize(metrics: PoolMetrics): Promise<void>;
  monitor(): ResourceStatus;
}

interface PoolMetrics {
  utilizationRate: number;
  allocationRate: number;
  releaseRate: number;
  failureRate: number;
  averageLatency: number;
}
```

### Key Components

1. Resource Pool Management
- Multi-tiered pools with priorities
- Dynamic resource allocation
- Resource tracking
- Automated reclamation
- Circuit breakers for protection
- LRU cache for frequent allocations

2. Allocation Strategies
- Priority-based allocation
- Resource reservation
- Quota management
- Fairness policies
- Deadlock prevention

3. Resource Tracking
- Usage monitoring
- Leak detection
- Health checks
- Performance metrics
- Resource tagging

4. Cleanup Mechanisms
- Automatic resource release
- Garbage collection
- Resource reclamation
- State cleanup
- Error recovery

## Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Priority |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Pool Allocation | <5ms | High |
| Pool Release | <3ms | High |
| Cache Hit Rate | >85% | Medium |
| Memory Overhead | <50MB | Medium |
| Cleanup Time | <100ms | Medium |

## Integration Points

### With Resource Detection (Phase 1)
```typescript
interface ResourceDetector {
  getCurrentResources(): SystemResources;
  getAvailability(): ResourceAvailability;
}
```

### With Health Monitor
```typescript
interface HealthMonitor {
  checkResourceHealth(): Promise<HealthStatus>;
  reportResourceMetrics(metrics: ResourceMetrics): void;
  alertResourceIssue(issue: ResourceIssue): void;
}
```

### With Task Router
```typescript
interface TaskRouter {
  routeTask(task: Task): Promise<Node>;
  getResourceRequirements(task: Task): ResourceRequest;
  validateResources(node: Node, request: ResourceRequest): boolean;
}
```

## Task

Implement Phase 2 of the resource management system, focusing on the pool management functionality. The implementation should:

1. Build on the existing resource detection system
2. Meet all performance targets
3. Integrate with health monitoring and task routing
4. Include comprehensive tests
5. Provide detailed documentation

Start with implementing the core pool manager and its tests, following the TypeScript interfaces and implementation steps outlined in this document.

Begin implementation in Code mode, following the implementation steps for detailed guidance.
