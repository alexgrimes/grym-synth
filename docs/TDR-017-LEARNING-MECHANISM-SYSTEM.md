### Key Components

1. **Pattern Learning Service**
   - Processes user feedback
   - Updates pattern confidence scores
   - Maintains pattern type statistics
   - Tracks learning effectiveness

2. **Pattern Relationship Tracker**
   - Discovers relationships between patterns
   - Maintains a graph of pattern relationships
   - Enables pattern-based search and suggestions

3. **Contextual Memory System**
   - Manages active pattern memory
   - Provides context-aware pattern retrieval
   - Optimizes memory usage through intelligent pruning

4. **Adaptive Confidence Modeler**
   - Analyzes pattern features
   - Considers contextual information
   - Adjusts confidence based on historical accuracy

5. **Learning Integration Service**
   - Coordinates between components
   - Manages the learning pipeline
   - Provides unified interface for client code

### Data Flow

1. New Pattern Detection:
   ```
   Audio Input → Pattern Detection → Learning Integration Service
   → Confidence Modeling → Contextual Memory → Relationship Analysis
   ```

2. Feedback Processing:
   ```
   User Feedback → Learning Integration Service → Pattern Learning Service
   → Update Relationships → Adjust Confidence → Update Memory
   ```

3. Pattern Retrieval:
   ```
   Context Query → Learning Integration Service → Contextual Memory
   → Relationship Analysis → Confidence Scoring → Filtered Results
   ```
