# Memory Management System Summary

## Overview
A robust memory management system designed for Node.js applications running in constrained environments (256MB heap). Based on empirical testing and real-world behavior patterns.

## Key Components

### 1. Basic Memory Manager
- Adaptive thresholds based on runtime environment
- Memory pressure detection
- Automatic cleanup and recovery
- Model loading/unloading management

### 2. Testing Infrastructure
- `MemoryTestUtils`: Comprehensive testing utilities
- Memory snapshot and comparison capabilities
- Controlled memory allocation/deallocation
- Leak detection

### 3. Monitoring Tools
- Real-time memory status monitoring
- Threshold violation alerts
- Memory usage statistics
- Performance tracking

## Memory Thresholds

Based on empirical measurements in 256MB environment:

```
Initial State:
- Baseline:     ~110-120MB
- Warning:      Baseline + 50MB  (~170MB)
- Critical:     Baseline + 70MB  (~190MB)
- Minimum Free: 30MB constant
```

## Memory Behavior Patterns

1. **Initial Load**
   - Base heap usage: 110-120MB
   - Available memory: ~140MB
   - Clean state: No warnings

2. **Normal Operation**
   - Heap usage: 120-160MB
   - Model loading successful
   - Automatic cleanup on model switches

3. **Warning State**
   - Heap usage: >170MB
   - Triggers cleanup attempts
   - May reject new model loads

4. **Critical State**
   - Heap usage: >190MB
   - Rejects all new allocations
   - Forces immediate cleanup

5. **Recovery**
   - Returns to 100-120MB
   - Cleanup success verified
   - Ready for new operations

## Testing Capabilities

1. **Basic Tests**
   ```typescript
   // Memory pressure simulation
   await memUtils.allocateMemory(50, arrays);
   
   // Memory state tracking
   const snapshot = memUtils.takeSnapshot();
   const impact = memUtils.compareToSnapshot(baseline);
   
   // Cleanup verification
   await memUtils.cleanup(arrays);
   ```

2. **Monitoring**
   ```typescript
   // Start real-time monitor
   ./monitor.sh  # Unix
   monitor.bat   # Windows
   ```

3. **Performance Tests**
   - Sequential model loading
   - Memory pressure handling
   - Recovery verification
   - Leak detection

## Best Practices

1. **Memory Management**
   - Check available memory before operations
   - Unload unused models promptly
   - Allow time for GC between operations
   - Monitor memory pressure regularly

2. **Testing**
   - Run memory tests with `--expose-gc`
   - Use controlled allocation sizes
   - Verify cleanup effectiveness
   - Track memory leaks

3. **Monitoring**
   - Watch for warning thresholds
   - Track peak memory usage
   - Monitor recovery effectiveness
   - Log memory pressure events

## Integration Example

```typescript
const manager = new BasicMemoryManager();

async function loadModel(name: string) {
  const info = manager.getMemoryInfo();
  
  if (info.isWarning) {
    await manager.attemptCleanup();
  }
  
  if (info.isCritical) {
    return false;
  }
  
  return manager.loadModel(name);
}
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Dynamic Thresholds**
   - Adjust based on usage patterns
   - Learn from performance data
   - Auto-tune for environment

2. **Advanced Monitoring**
   - Detailed memory analytics
   - Trend analysis
   - Predictive warnings

3. **Testing Enhancements**
   - Stress test scenarios
   - Memory fragmentation tests
   - Long-running stability tests
