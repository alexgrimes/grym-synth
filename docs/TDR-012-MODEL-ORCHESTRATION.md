# TDR-012: Model Orchestration System

## Status

Accepted and Implemented

## Context

We need a flexible system to coordinate multiple language models, each with different capabilities and strengths. The system should:

1. Efficiently route tasks to the most appropriate models
2. Combine results from multiple models effectively
3. Handle errors and edge cases gracefully
4. Be easily extensible for new model providers

## Decision

We implemented a model orchestration system with the following key components:

### 1. Core Components

- **ModelOrchestrator**: Central coordinator that manages model interactions
- **TaskAnalyzer**: Analyzes tasks to determine optimal model combinations
- **ResultSynthesizer**: Combines and formats results from multiple models

### 2. Model Providers

- **OllamaProvider**: Provider for Ollama models
- **LMStudioProvider**: Provider for LM Studio models
- **ModelProviderFactory**: Factory for creating and configuring providers

### 3. Model Chains

- **Default Chain**: General-purpose model combination
- **Specialized Chains**: Task-specific model combinations (code, planning, analysis)

## Architecture

```
ModelOrchestrator
├── TaskAnalyzer
│   └── ModelCapabilityDetector
├── ResultSynthesizer
│   └── OutputFormatter
└── ModelProviders
    ├── OllamaProvider
    ├── LMStudioProvider
    └── ModelProviderFactory
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Task Analysis

- Tasks are analyzed to determine required capabilities
- Models are selected based on capability scores and task requirements
- Resource constraints are considered (context window, memory usage)

### 2. Model Coordination

- Models can be chained for complex tasks
- Each model in the chain has a specific role (planner, executor, reviewer)
- Results are passed through the chain with appropriate context

### 3. Error Handling

- Comprehensive error handling with ModelOrchestratorError
- Graceful fallbacks for model failures
- Detailed error information for debugging

### 4. Extensibility

- New providers can be added by implementing the LLMModel interface
- Provider-specific capabilities can be defined
- Factory pattern makes configuration easy

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Single Model Approach

**Rejected** because:
- No single model excels at all tasks
- Different models have different strengths
- Resource constraints may require using smaller models

### 2. Fixed Model Chains

**Rejected** because:
- Lacks flexibility for different task types
- Cannot adapt to new models
- Difficult to optimize for specific use cases

### 3. Direct API Integration

**Rejected** because:
- Tightly couples to specific providers
- Harder to maintain and update
- Less flexible for local development

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Flexibility**: Easy to add new models and providers
2. **Optimization**: Tasks can use the most appropriate models
3. **Maintainability**: Clean separation of concerns
4. **Extensibility**: Well-defined interfaces for new features
5. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and recovery

### Negative

1. **Complexity**: More moving parts to manage
2. **Resource Usage**: Multiple models may require more resources
3. **Configuration**: More configuration options to manage
4. **Testing**: More complex testing scenarios

## Validation

The implementation has been validated through:

1. **Unit Tests**: All components have comprehensive tests
2. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end testing of model chains
3. **Performance Tests**: Resource usage and response times
4. **Error Scenarios**: Testing of various failure modes

## Migration

For existing code using direct model APIs:

1. Create appropriate provider implementations
2. Update model instantiation to use factory
3. Replace direct API calls with orchestrator usage
4. Test thoroughly with existing workflows

## References

1. Model Provider APIs:
   - [Ollama API](https://github.com/ollama/ollama)
   - [LM Studio API](https://lmstudio.ai/docs/api)

2. Design Patterns:
   - Factory Pattern
   - Strategy Pattern
   - Chain of Responsibility

   - TDR-001: Context Management
   - TDR-002: Error Recovery
   - TDR-007: Resource Management

## Future Considerations

1. **Dynamic Optimization**:
   - Runtime performance monitoring
   - Automatic model selection adjustment
   - Resource usage optimization

2. **Additional Providers**:
   - Cloud provider integration
   - More local model support
   - Custom model support

3. **Enhanced Features**:
   - Parallel model execution
   - Result caching
   - Model fine-tuning integration

## Appendix

### Example Usage

```typescript
// Create orchestrator with specialized chain
const orchestrator = new ModelOrchestrator({
  models: ModelProviderFactory.createSpecializedChain('code')
});

// Define task
const task = {
  type: 'code_generation',
  description: 'Create a React component',
  requirements: { language: 'typescript' }
};

// Handle task
const result = await orchestrator.handleTask(task);
```

### Configuration Example

```typescript
const config: ModelProviderConfig = {
  type: 'ollama',
  id: 'deepseek-coder',
  name: 'DeepSeek Coder',
  modelName: 'deepseek-coder',
  endpoint: 'http://localhost:11434',
  contextWindow: 32768,
  temperature: 0.7
};

const provider = ModelProviderFactory.createProvider(config);
