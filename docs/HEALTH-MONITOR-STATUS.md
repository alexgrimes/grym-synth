## Current Architecture

```typescript
// Historical state validation
const stateHistoryManager = new StateHistoryManager<TimestampedHealthState>(100);
stateHistoryManager.addEntry({
  ...healthState,
  timestamp: getCurrentTime()
});

// Validated state transitions
if (stateTransitionValidator.canTransition(currentState, newState)) {
  setHealthState(newState);
  
  // Add to history with timestamp
  stateHistoryManager.addEntry({
    ...newState,
    timestamp: getCurrentTime()
  });
}

// Trend-aware metric collection and analysis
const trend = stateHistoryManager.analyzeTrend('indicators.performance.score');
if (trend.direction === 'decreasing' && trend.magnitude > threshold) {
  // Take preemptive action
  adjustQuality(settings => settings.reduce());
}

// Dynamic thresholds based on system load
const context = { category: 'system', operation: 'quality', systemLoad: calculateSystemLoad() };
const thresholds = thresholdManager.getThresholds(context);
```
