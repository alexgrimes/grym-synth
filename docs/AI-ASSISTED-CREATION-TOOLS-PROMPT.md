# AI-Assisted Creation Tools Implementation Prompt

## Task Description

Implement the AI-Assisted Creation Tools for grym-synth as outlined in the implementation plan (docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN-2025-Q2.md). This should include:

1. Developing intelligent pattern suggestion algorithms
2. Creating automated audio enhancement tools
3. Implementing style transfer and transformation capabilities
4. Adding AI-driven composition assistance
5. Integrating with existing systems for a seamless creative workflow

## Technical Requirements

1. **Intelligent Pattern Suggestion**
   - Implement machine learning models for pattern recognition
   - Create a recommendation system for similar patterns
   - Develop next-step prediction for pattern sequences
   - Implement style-based pattern generation
   - Add user preference learning for personalized suggestions

2. **Automated Audio Enhancement**
   - Create AI-powered audio cleanup and restoration
   - Implement intelligent EQ and dynamics processing
   - Develop automated mixing assistance
   - Add spatial enhancement tools
   - Implement quality improvement suggestions

3. **Style Transfer and Transformation**
   - Create neural style transfer for audio patterns
   - Implement genre transformation capabilities
   - Develop instrument and timbre conversion
   - Add emotion and mood transformation
   - Implement historical style emulation

4. **AI Composition Assistance**
   - Create melody and harmony suggestion tools
   - Implement chord progression generation
   - Develop rhythmic pattern suggestions
   - Add structure and arrangement assistance
   - Implement complete composition generation from prompts

5. **Workflow Integration**
   - Connect AI tools with pattern recognition system
   - Integrate with MIDI generation for intelligent MIDI creation
   - Implement AI assistance in collaborative editing
   - Create visualization of AI suggestions and processes
   - Develop an AI assistant interface for creative guidance

## Implementation Approach

1. **Component Structure**
   - Create an AIModelManager for loading and running ML models
   - Implement CreativeAssistants for different suggestion types
   - Develop AudioEnhancers for sound improvement
   - Add StyleTransformers for audio transformation
   - Create CompositionAssistants for music creation help

2. **Technical Considerations**
   - Use TensorFlow.js or ONNX Runtime for client-side ML
   - Implement server-side processing for complex models
   - Use WebAssembly for performance-critical algorithms
   - Leverage transfer learning for efficient model deployment
   - Implement progressive enhancement based on device capabilities

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Create benchmark datasets for AI suggestion quality
   - Implement A/B testing for enhancement algorithms
   - Develop user testing protocols for creative assistance
   - Add performance testing for model inference time
   - Test across different device capabilities

## Success Criteria

1. AI suggestions are musically relevant and inspiring
2. Audio enhancement tools provide noticeable quality improvements
3. Style transfer creates convincing transformations
4. Composition assistance helps users overcome creative blocks
5. Integration with existing systems creates a seamless workflow
6. AI tools enhance rather than replace human creativity

## Next Steps

After completing the AI-Assisted Creation Tools implementation, the next step will be to implement the Performance Optimization System, which will ensure that all components of grym-synth work efficiently across different devices and usage scenarios, providing a smooth and responsive experience even with complex projects.

## Continuation Pattern

After completing and testing this implementation, please create a new prompt for the next step in the implementation plan (Performance Optimization System), and include instructions to continue this pattern of creating new task prompts until the core vision is fully implemented.
