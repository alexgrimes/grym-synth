# TDR-003: Dynamic Theme Discovery System

## Context

The application needs a more sophisticated way to organize and understand conversational content by discovering themes organically rather than using predefined categories. This requires a system that can:

1. Dynamically identify emerging themes from conversations
2. Track the evolution of concepts over time
3. Discover relationships between different themes
4. Adapt its understanding based on new information

## Decision

Implement a Dynamic Theme Discovery system using a graph-based approach that tracks concepts and their relationships over time. The system will use LLM analysis to identify concepts and their relationships, then maintain a weighted graph structure to track how these concepts evolve into themes.

### Core Components

1. Theme Graph
```typescript
interface ThemeNode {
  occurrences: number;
  relatedConcepts: Map<string, number>;
  firstSeen: Date;
  lastSeen: Date;
  conversations: Set<string>;
  evolution: {
    branches: Map<string, string[]>;
    depth: number;  // Theme complexity
    breadth: number;  // Related concept count
  }
}
```

2. LLM Analysis Pipeline
- Uses prompt engineering to identify concepts without bias
- Analyzes relationships between concepts
- Tracks discussion depth and patterns

3. Pattern Recognition System
- Identifies emerging themes based on frequency and complexity
- Tracks theme evolution over time
- Discovers unexpected connections between themes

### Key Architectural Characteristics

1. **Adaptability**
   - No predefined themes or categories
   - System learns and evolves based on actual usage
   - Themes can merge, split, or fade based on patterns

2. **Scalability**
   - Graph structure allows for efficient relationship tracking
   - Can handle growing number of themes and relationships
   - Supports parallel processing of conversations

3. **Maintainability**
   - Clear separation between analysis and storage
   - Modular design allows for LLM provider changes
   - Extensible for additional analysis features

4. **Observability**
   - Tracks temporal aspects (firstSeen, lastSeen)
   - Maintains evolution history
   - Provides metrics on theme significance

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Theme Graph Management

```typescript
class ThemeGraph {
  private nodes: Map<string, ThemeNode>;
  
  addNode(concept: string): void
  updateRelationships(concept: string, related: string[]): void
  pruneInactiveThemes(threshold: number): void
  getEmergingThemes(): string[]
  findConnections(): Map<string, string[]>
}
```

### 2. LLM Integration

```typescript
interface ThemeAnalysis {
  concepts: Array<{
    name: string;
    related: string[];
    depth: number;
  }>;
  patterns: {
    recurring: string[];
    emerging: string[];
  };
}

class ThemeAnalyzer {
  async analyzeConversation(content: string): Promise<ThemeAnalysis>
  async identifyPatterns(timeframe: TimeRange): Promise<Pattern[]>
}
```

### 3. Evolution Tracking

```typescript
interface EvolutionMetrics {
  depth: number;
  breadth: number;
  velocity: number;  // Rate of change
  stability: number; // Consistency over time
}

class EvolutionTracker {
  trackThemeChanges(theme: string, metrics: EvolutionMetrics): void
  getEvolutionHistory(theme: string): EvolutionMetrics[]
  predictTrends(): Map<string, TrendPrediction>
}
```

## Considerations

### Performance
- Graph operations should be optimized for large-scale theme networks
- Consider caching frequently accessed theme relationships
- Implement batch processing for bulk conversation analysis

### Storage
- Graph structure needs efficient persistence strategy
- Consider time-series data for evolution tracking
- Implement pruning strategy for inactive themes

### Privacy
- Ensure conversation content is properly anonymized
- Implement access controls for sensitive themes
- Consider data retention policies

### Scalability
- Design for distributed processing of conversations
- Implement sharding strategy for large theme graphs
- Consider eventual consistency for theme updates

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Traditional Taxonomy**
   - Fixed category system
   - Easier to implement
   - Less flexible and adaptive
   - Rejected due to lack of dynamism

2. **Pure Machine Learning**
   - Requires large training dataset
   - Higher computational overhead
   - Less interpretable results
   - Rejected due to complexity/resource requirements

3. **Hybrid Fixed/Dynamic**
   - Mix of predefined and discovered themes
   - More complex to maintain
   - Potential conflicts between systems
   - Rejected to maintain system simplicity

## Implementation Plan

1. Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
   - Implement basic theme graph structure
   - Set up LLM analysis pipeline
   - Create basic evolution tracking

2. Phase 2: Pattern Recognition
   - Implement emerging theme detection
   - Add relationship discovery
   - Build basic visualization tools

3. Phase 3: Advanced Features
   - Add predictive analytics
   - Implement theme merging/splitting
   - Create advanced reporting tools

## Success Metrics

1. **Theme Quality**
   - Relevance of discovered themes
   - Accuracy of relationships
   - User feedback on theme usefulness

2. **System Performance**
   - Processing time per conversation
   - Graph operation latency
   - Storage efficiency

3. **Adaptability**
   - Time to identify new themes
   - Accuracy of theme evolution tracking
   - Quality of relationship discovery
