# Audio Learning Hub - Test Execution Plan

This document outlines the recommended sequence for running the tests to validate the Audio Learning Hub system before release.

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure that:

1. The system is properly built:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. All dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. The environment is properly configured (environment variables, etc.)

## Test Execution Sequence

For the most effective validation of the system, run the tests in the following sequence:

### 1. Basic System Integration Tests

First, run the basic system integration tests to verify that all components initialize correctly and work together as expected:

```bash
npm run test:system:full
```

This will run the `full-system.test.ts` tests, which verify:
- System initialization and shutdown
- Core functionality
- Component interactions
- Basic error handling

**Expected outcome**: All tests should pass, confirming that the basic system integration is working correctly.

### 2. Error Recovery Tests

Next, run the error recovery tests to ensure the system can gracefully handle and recover from various error conditions:

```bash
npm run test:system:error
```

This will run the `error-recovery.test.ts` tests, which verify:
- Recovery from validation errors
- Recovery from timeout errors
- Recovery from resource errors
- Recovery from dependency errors
- Recovery from network errors
- Recovery from unexpected errors

**Expected outcome**: All tests should pass, confirming that the system can recover from various error conditions.

### 3. Performance Tests

Then run the performance tests to gain insights into system performance and identify any bottlenecks before deployment:

```bash
npm run test:performance
```

This will run all performance tests:
- End-to-end benchmarks
- Visualization performance tests
- Memory usage tests
- Throughput tests

**Expected outcome**: All tests should complete successfully, and the performance metrics should meet or exceed the defined thresholds.

### 4. User Acceptance Tests

Finally, run the user acceptance tests to validate the system from a user perspective and ensure it meets the requirements:

```bash
npm run test:uat
```

This will run all user acceptance test scenarios, such as:
- Basic audio processing
- (Other scenarios as defined)

**Expected outcome**: All scenarios should pass, confirming that the system meets user requirements.

## Running All Tests

To run all tests in sequence, you can use:

```bash
npm run test:all
```

This will run all the tests in the recommended sequence.

## Interpreting Test Results

After running the tests, review the results carefully:

1. **System Integration Tests**: Check for any failed tests, which indicate integration issues between components.

2. **Error Recovery Tests**: Verify that the system can recover from all error conditions. Pay special attention to critical errors.

3. **Performance Tests**: Review the performance metrics against the defined thresholds:
   - Operations per second
   - Response times
   - Memory usage
   - Throughput

4. **User Acceptance Tests**: Ensure all user scenarios pass. Any failures indicate that the system does not meet user requirements.

## Test Reports

Test reports are generated in the `reports` directory:

- System integration test reports: `reports/system/`
- Performance test reports: `reports/performance/`
- User acceptance test reports: `reports/uat/`

Review these reports for detailed information about the test results.

## Addressing Issues

If any tests fail or performance metrics do not meet the defined thresholds:

1. Identify the root cause of the issue
2. Make the necessary changes to fix the issue
3. Re-run the affected tests to verify the fix
4. If the fix affects multiple areas, re-run all tests to ensure no regressions

## Next Steps

After successfully running all tests and addressing any issues:

1. Document the test results and any issues that were addressed
2. Update the system documentation if necessary
3. Proceed to the final part of the implementation plan (Deployment and Release Preparation)

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be used to configure the tests:

### Performance Tests
- `BENCHMARK_ITERATIONS`: Number of iterations for benchmarks (default: 50)
- `VISUALIZATION_COMPLEXITY`: Complexity level for visualization tests (default: 5)
- `MEMORY_TEST_DURATION_MS`: Duration of memory tests in milliseconds (default: 60000)
- `THROUGHPUT_TARGET_OPS`: Target operations per second for throughput tests (default: 50)

### UAT Tests
- `UAT_TAGS`: Comma-separated list of tags to include (e.g., "smoke,critical")
- `UAT_MAX_PRIORITY`: Maximum priority to include (e.g., 2 for priority 1-2 only)
- `UAT_SMOKE_ONLY`: Set to "true" to run only smoke tests

Example:
```bash
UAT_TAGS=smoke,critical UAT_MAX_PRIORITY=2 npm run test:uat
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues running the tests:

1. **Test failures**: Check the test logs for detailed error messages
2. **Performance issues**: Review the system resources during test execution
3. **Timeout errors**: Increase the test timeout values if necessary
4. **Memory issues**: Ensure sufficient memory is available for the tests

For more detailed troubleshooting, refer to the test logs and reports.
