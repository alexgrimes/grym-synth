# grym-synth Dashboard Prototype

**Date:** March 9, 2025

## Overview

This prototype demonstrates the user interface for the grym-synth standalone application. It showcases the core features and navigation structure that will be implemented according to the [Implementation Plan for Q2 2025](../../docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN-2025-Q2.md).

## Features Demonstrated

1. **Main Dashboard** - Overview of the system with quick access to key features
2. **Text-to-Audio Generation** - Interface for creating audio from text descriptions
3. **Audio Editor** - Tools for visualizing and manipulating audio patterns
4. **Musical Concept Explorer** - Interface for experimenting with high-level musical concepts

## How to Use

### Running the Prototype

1. Ensure you have Next.js installed and configured
2. Import the dashboard-prototype.tsx file into your Next.js application
3. Add the appropriate route configuration to make it accessible

```typescript
// In your app/routes.ts or similar file
import DashboardPrototype from './dashboard-prototype';

export default function Routes() {
  return [
    {
      path: '/prototype',
      element: <DashboardPrototype />
    }
    // Other routes...
  ];
}
```

### Development Notes

This prototype is built with:
- React and Next.js
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- SVG icons for UI elements

The prototype is designed to be responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Implementation Details

The prototype is structured as a single React component with the following sections:

1. **Header** - Contains the application title and navigation tabs
2. **Main Content** - Changes based on the selected tab:
   - Home - Overview dashboard with quick actions and recent projects
   - Generate - Text-to-audio generation interface
   - Editor - Audio visualization and editing tools
   - Concepts - Musical concept exploration interface

## Next Steps

This prototype serves as a visual reference for the implementation of the actual grym-synth application. The next steps are:

1. Connect the UI to the existing backend services (AudioLDM, XenakisLDM)
2. Implement the actual visualization components using the existing code
3. Add touch gesture support for interactive manipulation
4. Develop the MIDI generation capabilities
5. Package as a standalone Electron application

## Relation to Core Vision

This prototype aligns with grym-synth's core vision by:

1. Providing an intuitive interface for text-to-audio synthesis
2. Showcasing the visualization and manipulation capabilities
3. Demonstrating the concept of musical parameter exploration
4. Presenting a unified experience that brings together all core features

## Technical Considerations

When implementing the full version:

1. Use React context for state management across components
2. Implement WebGL for high-performance visualizations
3. Use Web Workers for computation-heavy operations
4. Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG AA)
5. Optimize for touch interactions on various devices
