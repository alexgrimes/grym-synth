# Audio Model Testing Framework

This testing framework provides a comprehensive suite for evaluating audio model capabilities, performance, and integration metrics.

## Features

- Latency testing (single request, concurrent, streaming)
- Quality metrics (audio fidelity, transcription accuracy)
- Resource utilization monitoring
- Integration testing with existing systems
- Detailed test reporting

## Usage

```typescript
import { AudioModel } from '../../types/testing';
import { AudioModelTestFramework } from './audio-model-test-framework';

// Configure your model
const model: AudioModel = {
  id: 'my-audio-model',
  name: 'My Audio Model',
  capabilities: {
    transcription: true,
    synthesis: true,
    streaming: true
  }
};

// Run tests
async function runTests() {
  const framework = new AudioModelTestFramework();
  const results = await framework.evaluateModel(model);
  console.log(results);
}
```

## Test Categories

### 1. Capability Tests
- Single request latency
- Concurrent request handling
- Streaming performance
- Audio quality metrics
- Transcription accuracy

### 2. Resource Tests
- Memory usage
- GPU utilization
- Scaling efficiency

### 3. Integration Tests
- Model handoff latency
- Error recovery
- State consistency

## Custom Test Suites

You can create custom test suites:

```typescript
const customSuite: AudioTestSuite = {
  name: "Custom Audio Tests",
  description: "Specialized tests for specific use cases",
  testCases: [
    {
      name: "High-fidelity transcription",
      description: "Tests transcription quality with high-quality audio",
      input: {
        type: "file",
        data: "high-quality-sample.wav",
        duration: 30
      },
      expectedOutput: {
        type: "transcription",
        data: "Expected transcript...",
        accuracy: 0.98
      }
    }
  ]
};

const framework = new AudioModelTestFramework(customSuite);
```

## Test Reports

The framework generates detailed test reports including:
- Test execution summary
- Coverage metrics
- Performance metrics
- Audio-specific metrics
- Integration metrics

Example report structure:
```typescript
{
  summary: {
    totalTests: 10,
    passed: 9,
    failed: 1,
    skipped: 0
  },
  coverage: {
    statements: 95,
    branches: 85,
    functions: 100,
    lines: 92
  },
  performance: {
    executionTime: 1500,
    resourceUsage: {
      memory: 512,
      cpu: 0.75
    },
    successRate: 0.9,
    errorRate: 0.1
  },
  audioMetrics: {
    latency: {
      singleRequest: 100,
      avgConcurrent: 150,
      streamingLatency: 50
    },
    quality: {
      audioFidelity: 0.95,
      transcriptionAccuracy: 0.92,
      contextRetention: 0.88
    }
  },
  integrationMetrics: {
    handoffLatency: 75,
    errorRecoveryTime: 200,
    stateConsistency: 0.95
  }
}
```

## Running Tests

You can run tests using the provided script:

```bash
# Run all audio model tests
npm run test:audio-models

# Run specific test suite
npm run test:audio-models -- --suite=basic
```

## Integration with CI/CD

The testing framework is designed to work with CI/CD pipelines. Test results can be exported in various formats for integration with monitoring and reporting tools.

## Error Handling

The framework includes robust error handling and reporting:
- Test failures are clearly identified
- Resource exhaustion is detected
- Integration issues are tracked
- Detailed error logs are generated

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements:
1. Advanced audio quality metrics
2. Automated test case generation
3. Performance benchmarking
4. Extended integration testing
5. Cloud resource monitoring

## Contributing
