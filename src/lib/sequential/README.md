# Memory-Aware Sequential Audio Processing

This implementation provides a memory-constrained approach to audio model processing, designed to work within a 16GB RAM limit.

## Architecture Overview

### Sequential Orchestrator
- Loads one model at a time
- Actively manages memory usage
- Enforces sequential processing
- Implements memory-aware task planning

### Memory Management
- Hard limit of 16GB RAM
- Active memory monitoring
- Forced cleanup between model switches
- Memory profiling and reporting

## Components

### 1. Sequential Orchestrator
```typescript
class SequentialOrchestrator {
  async loadModel(type: ModelType): Promise<void>
  async unloadModel(): Promise<void>
  async processTask(task: AudioTask): Promise<any>
}
```

### 2. Memory Profiler
```typescript
class MemoryProfiler {
  start(): void
  stop(): void
  generateReport(): string
}
```

### 3. Minimal Test Framework
```typescript
class MinimalTestFramework {
  async modelTests()
  async orchestrationTests()
}
```

## Usage

### Running Tests with Memory Constraints

```bash
# Run sequential tests with garbage collection enabled
npm run test:sequential

# Run with memory profiling
npm run test:profile

# Run memory-intensive tests with explicit garbage collection
npm run test:memory
```

### Memory Monitoring

The system provides real-time memory monitoring:
- Peak memory usage
- Memory usage trends
- Leak detection
- GC effectiveness

### Test Categories

1. **Load/Unload Tests**
   - Verify proper memory cleanup
   - Check for memory leaks
   - Monitor peak usage

2. **Processing Tests**
   - Sequential task execution
   - Memory stability
   - Resource cleanup

3. **Error Handling**
   - Oversized model rejection
   - Resource exhaustion handling
   - Graceful degradation

## Memory Constraints

### Model Loading
- Models are loaded sequentially
- Memory is verified before loading
- Automatic unloading when switching models

### Task Processing
- Tasks are processed one at a time
- Memory is monitored during processing
- Forced cleanup between tasks

### Error Handling
- Rejects operations that would exceed memory limits
- Implements graceful fallbacks
- Maintains system stability under pressure

## Best Practices

1. **Memory Management**
   - Always unload models when not in use
   - Monitor memory usage trends
   - Implement cleanup routines

2. **Task Planning**
   - Break large tasks into smaller chunks
   - Plan sequential processing steps
   - Consider memory requirements

3. **Testing**
   - Run with memory profiling enabled
   - Monitor long-running operations
   - Test error recovery scenarios

## Performance Considerations

While this approach prioritizes memory stability over raw performance:
- Models are loaded/unloaded more frequently
- Processing is sequential rather than parallel
- Additional overhead from memory monitoring

These tradeoffs ensure reliable operation within memory constraints.

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Memory Profiling
```typescript
const profiler = new MemoryProfiler();
profiler.start();
// Run operations
profiler.stop();
console.log(profiler.generateReport());
```

### Test Reports
```typescript
const framework = new MinimalTestFramework();
const results = await framework.modelTests();
console.log(results);
```

## Error Handling

The system implements several layers of protection:
1. Pre-execution memory checks
2. Active monitoring during execution
3. Forced cleanup on errors
4. Graceful degradation strategies

## Future Improvements

1. Dynamic memory allocation based on task priority
2. More sophisticated task planning
3. Improved memory prediction
4. Enhanced error recovery strategies

## Contributing

When adding features:
1. Always consider memory implications
2. Include memory profiling in tests
3. Document memory requirements
4. Test with constrained resources
